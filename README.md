# DropDown Game Framework

Welcome to the DropDown Project! A game developed to create and refine my first openGL gameFramework. It is a simple yet powerful framework for creating 2D games using C#, OpenGL, and OpenTK. The project consists of two main components: the game itself `DropDown`, and the underlying engine `Core`.

## Features

- **Simple and Lightweight**: Designed to be easy to understand and quick to set up for your game development needs.
- **Focused on 2D Games**: While the framework is capable of handling basic 3D operations through OpenGL, its primary focus is on 2D game development.
- **Reusable Components**: The `Core` component of the framework provides a collection of reusable subsystems for handling various aspects of game development, allowing for easy creation of additional games using the same foundation.
- **OpenGL and OpenTK**: Leveraging the power of OpenGL and OpenTK for graphics rendering and cross-platform compatibility.

## Components

### 1. DropDown Game

DropDown is a simple game built on top of the Core engine. It serves as a demonstration of the framework's capabilities.

### 2. Core Engine

The Core component is a class library that holds the core implementations of all subsystems required for game development. It provides functionality for graphics rendering, physics, input handling, audio playback, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with this Game Framework, simply clone this repository and explore the codebase. You can use the framework to develop your own games or extend the existing `DropDown` game.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mich-Dich/DropDown
```

## Usage

1. **Explore the Code**: Take a look at the source code of `DropDown` and `Core` to understand how the framework is structured and how it can be used.
2. **Create Your Game**: Use the `Core` component to build your own 2D games, leveraging the provided subsystems and utilities.
3. **Contribute**: If you find any issues or have ideas for improvements, feel free to contribute by opening an issue or submitting a pull request.
